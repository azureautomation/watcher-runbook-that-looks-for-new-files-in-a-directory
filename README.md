Watcher runbook that looks for new files in a directory
=======================================================

            

Watcher runbook that looks for new files in a directory and triggers an action runbook to process the files. This is a sample to show how to create and use watcher tasks in an Automation account.


It requires that a variable called 'Watch-NewFileTimestamp' be created in the automaiton account that is used to hold the timestamp of the last file processed. 


 


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
